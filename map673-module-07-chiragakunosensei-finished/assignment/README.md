# Assignment Part II. Final Project Proposal

Submit a 1-2 page written project proposal (**5 points**) that includes:

**updated from assignment 06**

* description of data topic (with an anticipated map title)
* map objectives
* user needs, articulated through a persona/scenario
* data sources
* any updated specific feedback from your instructor

**new this week**

* identification of anticipated thematic representation (e.g., dot map, choropleth, prop symbols, etc.)
* a content and requirements list (see Module 05)
* description of the anticipated user interaction (UI)
* a series of low fidelity wireframes, paper prototypes, or mockups (in addition to the 1-2 pages)

Please submit this proposal in the Markdown format. However, ensure spelling and grammar are correct (you can paste Markdown into a spelling checker, or search for spelling plugins for your text editor of choice).

Also, include a brief description of your anticipated technologies you'll use to complete the project:

### Anticipating your technology stack

While your answer to this question need not be definite at this point, briefly describe the "technology stack" you plan to use for your final map. Your description of the technology stack should include:

* data and information processing tools, web-based or desktop (i.e., QGIS, [MapShaper](http://www.mapshaper.org/))
* the format you'll use to store your data (i.e., flat files such as CSV or GeoJSON, database technology such as CARTO)
* the JS libraries you anticipate using or need (include any relevant plugins)
* other relevant web technologies you'll be using (i.e., HTML, CSS)
* the hosting platform you intend to use to host your map (i.e., GitHub pages, your own web server, [http://surge.sh/](http://surge.sh/))

Note: This is a draft of the information we'll want to include in your final map project. While informative to curious users of your map, the proposal also looks good to employers and clients in terms of demonstrating your expertise in the world of open source web mapping!
